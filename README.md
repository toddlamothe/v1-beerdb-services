# Beerdb - an app for beer lovers

I needed to learn how to develop an Angular that calls a C# RESTful API - quickly. This project demonstrates how to build a simple RESTful API using C# by connecting to [[BreweryDB](http://www.brewerydb.com/)](http://www.brewerydb.com/) - a free yet useful public API providing up to date information on your favorite beer and breweries. The service layer in a work in progress.

The web code is located in the beerdb-web repo.
